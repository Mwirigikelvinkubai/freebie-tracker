# Freebie Tracker


A Phase 3 Code Challenge project built with Python and SQLAlchemy.



Freebie Tracker is an app that helps developers keep track of the promotional items (freebies) they receive from different tech companies during events like hackathons and conferences.

The application models real-world relationships between developers, companies, and the freebies they exchange using SQLAlchemy ORM.
